A multisignature HD Bitcoin Cash wallet service.

## Attribution

This repository was created by copy forking [bitcore-wallet-service commit b6d9048](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service/commit/b6d904800196f48329f6f10d4cc191b6964ba105).

# Description

Bcccore Wallet Service facilitates multisig HD wallets creation and operation through a (hopefully) simple and intuitive REST API.

BCCWS can usually be installed within minutes and accommodates all the needed infrastructure for peers in a multisig wallet to communicate and operate – with minimum server trust.
  
See [Bcccore-wallet-client](https://github.com/owstack/bcccore-wallet-client) for the *official* client library that communicates to BCCWS and verifies its response. Also check [Bcccore-wallet](https://github.com/owstack/bcccore-wallet) for a simple CLI wallet implementation that relays on BCCWS.

# Getting Started
```
 git clone https://github.com/owstack/bcccore-wallet-service.git
 cd bcccore-wallet-service && npm start
```

This will launch the BCCWS service (with default settings) at `http://localhost:3232/bccws/api`.

BCCWS needs mongoDB. You can configure the connection at `config.js`

BCCWS supports SSL and Clustering. For a detailed guide on installing BCCWS with extra features see [Installing BCCWS](https://github.com/owstack/bcccore-wallet-service/blob/master/installation.md). 

BCCWS uses by default a Request Rate Limitation to CreateWallet endpoint. If you need to modify it, check defaults.js' `Defaults.RateLimit`

# Security Considerations
 * Private keys are never sent to BCCWS. Copayers store them locally.
 * Extended public keys are stored on BCCWS. This allows BCCWS to easily check wallet balance, send offline notifications to copayers, etc.
 * During wallet creation, the initial copayer creates a wallet secret that contains a private key. All copayers need to prove they have the secret by signing their information with this private key when joining the wallet. The secret should be shared using secured channels.
 * A copayer could join the wallet more than once, and there is no mechanism to prevent this. See [wallet](https://github.com/owstack/bcccore-wallet)'s confirm command, for a method for confirming copayers.
 * All BCCWS responses are verified:
  * Addresses and change addresses are derived independently and locally by the copayers from their local data.
  * TX Proposals templates are signed by copayers and verified by others, so the BCCWS cannot create or tamper with them.

# REST API
## Authentication

  In order to access a wallet, clients are required to send the headers:
```
  x-identity
  x-signature
```
Identity is the Peer-ID, this will identify the peer and its wallet. Signature is the current request signature, using `requestSigningKey`, the `m/1/1` derivative of the Extended Private Key.

See [Bcccore Wallet Client](https://github.com/owstack/bcccore-wallet-client/blob/master/lib/api.js#L73) for implementation details.

Returns:
 * History of incoming and outgoing transactions of the wallet. The list is paginated using the `skip` & `limit` params. Each item has the following fields:

 * lockedConfirmedAmount: Same as lockedAmount for confirmed UTXOs only.
 * availableConfirmedAmount: Same as availableAmount for confirmed UTXOs only.
 * byAddress array ['address', 'path', 'amount']: A list of addresses holding funds.
 * totalKbToSendMax: An estimation of the number of KiB required to include all available UTXOs in a tx (including unconfirmed).

`/v1/txnotes/:txid`:  Get user notes associated to the specified transaction.
Returns:
 * The note associated to the `txid` as a string.

`/v1/fiatrates/:code`:  Get the fiat rate for the specified ISO 4217 code.
Optional Arguments:
